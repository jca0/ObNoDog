PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net mnt_ccl_1/addra_1_reg[15]_i_2_n_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mnt_ccl_1/addra_1_reg[15]_i_2/O, cell mnt_ccl_1/addra_1_reg[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check
